# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

Welcome to the SQL evaluated project.

This project aimed at examining data comprising of 5 tables spanning a period of 1 year begining Aug 1, 2016 to Aug 1, 2017, for a e-commerce site.
Applying combined, learned and researched concepts in SQL to clean, QA, analyze and report on the ecomerce historical data to identify patterns, correlations between data types, and draw informed conclusions and inferences from the data, for decision making and further investigation.



# Assumptions

The ecommerce site is located, or at least targetted at the US market, based on the majority of the transaction's geographical location


## Process
### (your step 1)

Employed standard data cleaning techniques detailed in the data cleaning and QA sections.

### (your step 2)

Data analysis, data interpretation

## Results

The results are listed in the answers question of the document
An unknown city and Mountainside city both in the US led in revenue from purchases



## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

Not knowing the significance of  missing data values,and their potential impact on the results
It is also unknown due to lack of contextual preceeding and followingdata, if this data set is within normal expected performance


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

Explore what products were popular in other countries and why, and explore viability of this potential opprtunity
Deep dive on the reasons why the USA was the leading market, to ascertain if strategies employed can be replicated in other markets

Further investigation into the low website visitor to purchase conversion, 
As well as the visits that lasted 0 seconds, for technical glitch, access issues or other avoidable barriers
